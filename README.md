# Udacity-DataWrangling
An exercise on data wrangling.
As a Data Scientist/ Data Analyst, your prediction and models are only as effective as your dataset. This means that it is important that the data is gathered, thoroughly assessed for quality and tidiness issues and then properly cleaned. Without proper wrangling, the entire analysis can be inaccurate or meaningless.
This project focuses on the data wrangling process. 
The datasets are gathered, assessed for quality and tidiness, and cleaned before insights and visualizations are made. 
Using python's pandas package, I cleaned the dataset so as to make it more comprehensive, tidy and of better quality.

The entire wrangling process and analysis can be found in the 'wrangle-act.ipynb' file. Comprehensive reports are made on the wrangling and analysis in the 'wrangle-report.ipynb' and 'act-report.ipynb' files respectively.
